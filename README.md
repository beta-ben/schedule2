# Schedule 2

React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind. Includes a dedicated **Remove Shifts** interface, Cloudflare Worker sync, and a password-gated Manage area.

## Quickstart

```bash
npm i
cp .env.example .env   # optional, then edit
npm run dev
```

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

This project is preconfigured with Vite `base` = `/schedule2/`. So you can just:

```bash
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

Then in GitHub → Settings → Pages: choose `gh-pages` as the source.  
Your URL will be: `https://<username>.github.io/schedule2/`
